Next, we'll install the Terraform CDK Toolkit. The toolkit is a command-line utility
which allows you to work with TerraConstructs apps.

Open a terminal session and run the following command:

- Windows: you'll need to run this as an Administrator
- POSIX: on some systems you may need to run this with `sudo`

```
npm install -g cdktf-cli
```

You can check the toolkit version:

```
$ cdktf --version
{{% cdkversion %}}
```

Okay, we've got a Terraform configuration. What's next? __Let's deploy it into our account!__

## Let's deploy

Use `cdktf deploy` to deploy a CDK app:

```
cdktf deploy
```

The Terraform configuration is first used to initialize `terraform`.

```
cdk-workshop  Initializing the backend...
cdk-workshop
              Successfully configured the backend "local"! Terraform will automatically
              use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.
cdk-workshop  Initializing provider plugins...
              - Finding hashicorp/aws versions matching "5.100.0"...
cdk-workshop  - Installing hashicorp/aws v5.100.0...
              ....


0 Stacks deploying     0 Stacks done     1 Stack waiting
```

Once initialised a `plan` will be presented

```text
Plan: 4 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

              Do you want to perform these actions?
                Terraform will perform the actions described above.
                Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

Please review the diff output above for cdk-workshop
‚ùØ Approve  Applies the changes outlined in the plan.

```

These are the changes that Terraform will make to your infrastructure. Choose `Approve` to apply these changes.

Output should look like the following:

## The Terraform CLI

CDKTF apps are deployed through `terraform` CLI. Each CDKTF stack maps 1:1 with
a terraform folder under `cdktf.out/stacks/`.

This means that you can use the `terraform` CLI in order to manage
your stacks.

Let's take a look at the contents of the Terraform state.

You will likely see something like this:

```
cd cdktf.out/stacks/cdk-workshop
terraform state list
```

```text
data.aws_caller_identity.CallerIdentity
data.aws_iam_policy_document.CdkWorkshopQueue_Policy_E8C1B641
data.aws_partition.Partitition
data.aws_service_principal.aws_svcp_default_region_sns
aws_sns_topic.CdkWorkshopTopic_D368A42F
aws_sns_topic_subscription.CdkWorkshopQueue_cdk-workshopCdkWorkshopTopicA7BCA841_F6BFFB7B
aws_sqs_queue.CdkWorkshopQueue_50D9D426
aws_sqs_queue_policy.CdkWorkshopQueue_Policy_AF2494A5
```

This workshop is focused on defining the infrastructure.

# I am ready for some actual coding!

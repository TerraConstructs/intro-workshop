# Congratulations!

You've successfully finished our __Introduction to TerraConstructs on AWS workshop!

In this workshop, you've learned how to:

- Create a new CDKTF project in TypeScript using `cdktf init`
- Augment CDKTF with TerraConstructs
- Add resources to your CDK application stack
- Use `cdktf diff` and `cdktf deploy` to deploy your app to an AWS environment
- Author and use your own custom construct (`HitCounter`)
- Consume a construct from another npm module (`cdk-dynamo-table-viewer`)
- Use the AWS Lambda, API Gateway and DynamoDB AWS TerraConstructs

## What's next?

TerraConstructs is a work in progress. It is currently in Alpha stage. We'd
love to hear what you think about every aspect of the framework.

Here are a few things you can do from here:

* __Build something__: build something real with TerraConstructs and let us know how it
  went. What worked? What was intuitive? What was completely misleading?
* __Publish construct libraries__: start thinking about infrastructure in terms
  of small reusable modules instead of monolithic templates. Pick up a useful
  thing you've built and try to design a beautiful API for it. Share it with the
  community and let us know about it. We'll be curating a list of constructs,
  and would love to list yours.
<!--
* Create a simple app in the [Hello World Tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/CDK/latest/userguide/hello_world_tutorial.html)
  with the CDK in one of the supported languages: Java, .NET, JavaScript and TypeScript
* Dive deeper into [CDK
  Concepts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/core_concepts.html):
  [Constructs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/CDK/latest/userguide/constructs.html),
  [Apps](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/CDK/latest/userguide/apps.html) and [Stacks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/CDK/latest/userguide/stacks.html),

* Explore the [AWS Construct
  Library](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/CDK/latest/userguide/aws_construct_lib.html) and the
  [reference documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-construct-library.html)
  which already contains constructs for many AWS resources such as
  [EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-ec2-readme.html),
  [AutoScaling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-autoscaling-readme.html),

  [Step Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-stepfunctions-readme.html)
  and many more...
* Read guidelines on how to [write your own
  constructs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/CDK/latest/userguide/writing_constructs.html)
-->
* Learn about [__jsii__](https://github.com/awslabs/jsii), the technology
  behind the CDK's multi-language support
